    <H1>Recipe for Homemade Chicken Schnitzel</H1>
    <img class="poster" src="Schnitzel.jpg" alt="">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Get flour, eggs and Panko breadcrumps. Put each in its own bowl, then take out the chicken schnitzel (2cm thick maximum) and season with pepper,salt and sweet paprika<br>
    After, put the chicken in the flour first, then the egg (make sure everything is covered with egg), and then into the breadcrumps<br>
    Put the chicken into the hot oil (the oil shouldn't be too hot, you dont want to burn the chicken, also dont use too little oil), and turn once the edges get golden brown<br>
    </p>
    <p>After you take out the chicken, put them on a piece of paper that can soak up any oil. Now is also the time to prepare the fried potatoes. For that, peel potatoes<br>
    and cut them in small pieces, wether those are discs or just triangles is up to you, the pieces should not be bigger than 3cm for easier and faster frying<br>
    Fry the potatoes in a bit of oil, season with salt, pepper, sweet paprika, garlic powder, and a little thymen. Add thymen again at the end.</p>
