    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>You first fry the meat in a seperate pot, add peper and sweet paprika powder to it. After it lost all its red color, add some beef stock to it and let it fry for a bit longer<br>
    While the meat is frying, cut the vegetables (carrots, onions, selery) and fry them together with some pancetta (bacon works too)<br>
    Once the onions become glassy, add the meat to the vegetables and let it fry for a bit, make sure to stir the pot<br>
    </p>
    <p>After a short amount of time, add red wine to kill the heat, then add tomato paste (3x concentrated) and mix it. Now you add your canned tomatoes and mix again.<br>
    The last step involves adding 350ml of vegetable stock to it, then let it cook on low to medium heat and keep the lid closed. Stir every 15 minutes, if the contents are not swimming<br>
    in stock/water, add more water. After 2 hours you can turn off the heat and tastetest. If it's sour or bitter, add sugar. Add salt, pepper, basel and oregano as you please </p>
